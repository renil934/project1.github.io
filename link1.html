   <br></br>
   <p><u>Observations and Insights</u></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Total Vs Maths:</strong> Maximum bin concentration occurs in region between 20 to 40 percentage achieved in Maths and 20  to 45 percentage in Overall.</li>
<li> <strong>Total Vs Reading:</strong> Maximum bin concentration occurs in region between 20 to 75 percentage achieved in Maths and 20  to 60 percentage in Overall.</li>
<li> <strong>Total Vs Science:</strong> Maximum bin concentration occurs in region between 20 to 40 percentage achieved in Maths and 20  to 40 percentage in Overall.</li>
 <li><strong>Total Vs Social:</strong> Maximum bin concentration occurs in region between 20 to 50 percentage achieved in Maths and 20  to 45 percentage in Overall.</li>
  </ul>
   <p><strong><u>Insight Observed</u>:  From the observations, we can note that Subjects: Maths, Science and Social have similar bin concentration with respect to the total score,but Subject Reading is uniformly distributed by increasing with respect to increase in total percentage.

<h2>Effect of Age, Gender, Siblings and Category of Student on Overall Percentage Scored</h2>

<img src='https://renil934.github.io/project1.github.io/images21/sib1.JPG'/,alt="Smiley face" height="250" width="450">
 <br></br>
<p><u>Observations and Insights</u></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Age:</strong>Age group between 12 to 14 perform well compared to other groups.</li>
 <li><strong>Siblings:</strong> Students having one sibling has <strong>2.5 percent</strong> more in total performance compared to those who have more than four siblings.</li>
 </ul><p><strong><u>Insight Observed</u></strong>: Students with very few siblings tend to perform well, might be because they might have an advantage to draw lot of attention in their academic life.
 There is no surprise that age group from 12 to 14 perform well, since many students in class VIII are in that age group</p><hr>

 <br></br>
<p><u>Observations and Insights</u></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Father Education:</strong>Students with father having degree or more tends to perform more and students with father who are illiterate perform the least.   </li>
<li> <strong>Mother Education:</strong> Students with mother having degree or more tends to perform more and students with mother who are illiterate perform the least.  </li>
<li> <strong>Father Occupation:</strong> Students with father having occupation as a professional or Teacher/lecturer tends to perform more and students with father who are unemployed perform the least.    </li>
 <li><strong>Mother Occupation:</strong> Students with father mother occupation as a Teacher/lecturer tends to perform more and students with mother who are skilled labourer perform the least </li>
 </ul><p><strong><u>Insight Observed</u></strong>: Parents education and occupation matters a lot in a childs performance in academics.
 The reason under usual circumstances is that parents with high education and occupation can provide good facilities and better environment 
  to their children than any parents who are illiterate and unemployed.</p><hr>

 <h2>The Effect of Poverty and Handicaped on Total Percent Scored</h2>

 <br></br>
<p><u>Observations and Insights</u></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Below Poverty</strong> Students who are not below poverty line has <strong>3 percent</strong> more in total performance compared to those who are under poverty line.  </li>
<li> <strong>Handicap:</strong> Students who are not handicaped has <strong>3.5 percent</strong> more in total performance compared to those who are handicaped.  </li>
 </ul><p><strong><u>Insight Observed</u></strong>: Students who are handicaped or below poverty are stuggling to keep up with the 
 perfomance of the students who does not face their disadvantage.</p><hr>
 <br></br>
<h2>Effect of Reading a Book or Magazine, Helping in the Household and Playing Games on Total percentage Scored</h2>

<br></br>
<p><u>Observations and Insights</u></p>
<ul>
<li>Students who read magazines everyday and help in households once a week shows high probability in getting good scores. </li>
<li>Students who help in households everyday and read book shows high performance.</li>
 </ul><p><strong><u>Insight Observed</u></strong>: From the NSA dataset, one of the most fascinating insight was how students who 
do a lot of household help tends to increase their performance in subjects.A student of class VIII helping in households itself will 
express a lot of his/her character and how effectively that can be reflected in his/her academics. </p><hr>

 <br></br>
<p><u>Observations and Insights</u></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>State With High Performance:</strong> States with high performing students are Daman & Diu, Uttar Pradesh,Dadra & Nagar Haveli Tripure, Kerala, Goa, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and West Bengal.   </li>
<li> <strong>State With low Performance:</strong> States with low performing students are Pondicherry, Tamil Nadu and Meghalaya.  </li>

 </ul><p><strong><u>Insight Observed</u>: Students from North India shows good overall performance compared to South India.</strong></p><hr>

<h2>Effect of Usage of Computers and Library, Subjects and Liking School on Total Percentage Scored</h2>

<p><u>Observations and Insights</u></p>
<ul>
<li>Students using computer once in a week and holds 25+ books shows high performance.   </li>
<li>Students using computer once in a week and uses library once or twice in a month shows high performance.   </li>
 </ul> <p><strong><u>Insight Observed</u>: Although performance of students is high for those who use computer once
   in a week, from the bar plot it can be observed that many students who doesnot use computer are more likely to perform more
   compared to those students who use it more than a week.</strong></p><hr>
